# console-finances

## Description
In this weeks challenges, I created code to analyse the financal records of a company. This was my first time using javascript but all the necessary information required for this projected can be viewed in the code. 

## Installation

No steps required to install project.

## Usage

You can directly view the financal records of the company by opening the index.html file in chrome, right-clicking, and clicking inspect. From there you should navigate to console where the financal records should be displayed.

This is how the code should display:

# console-finances

## Description
In this weeks challenges, I made a new portfolio largely composed of bootstrap elements. I used various bootstrap components such as navbar, jumbotrons/headers, and cards. These all came with built in responsiveness which was extremely ideal.

## Installation

No steps required to install project.

## Usage

You can directly view the financal records of the company by opening the index.html file in chrome, right-clicking, and clicking inspect. From there you should navigate to console where the financal records should be displayed.

This is how the code should display:
